Most player versus player games focus on agency. It's all about developing skills and action plans to take out your opponent with superior decision-making. Agency plays a big role in helping players step into the fantasies that these types of games usually aim to provide. For example, Mortal Combat puts you in the fantasy of being a powerful warrior who has to defeat his opponents, and having free reign to use your moves however you'd like is pivitol to experiencing this fantasy. This focus on agency and fantasy largely places the pace, sequencing of events, and results of a game in the hands of the players, making it challenging for the game developers to tell a story. However, there are a handful of games that have managed to hijack the inverse relationship between player agency and storytelling as explained by Zubeck in Elements of Game Design. Valorant manages to tell a story while providing players with high amounts of agency and fantasy through exploiting it's genre and advancing its narrative outside of game sessions. 

But what is Valorant's genre? And how does it exploit this?

Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter. Players win rounds by planting a bomb on a site and defending it, taking out the enemy team, or defending a site from planters. Teams work together to create strategies and utilize their individual aiming and game sense skills to take duels and map control. The way that each round plays out is heavily dependant on player actions and the devs have little to no control over what these decisions will be. Hence, there is no story that players are trying to get to the end of; the main motivation for continuing to play is to improve and to make connections.
