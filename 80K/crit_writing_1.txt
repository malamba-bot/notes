FIRST DRAFT
Most player versus player games focus on agency. When player competition is the main focus of a game, agency must be high to accomodate the fantasy of being a competitor. For example, Mortal Combat puts you in the fantasy of being a powerful warrior who has to defeat his opponents. If the player didn't have full control over their character, it would pull them right out of the combat experience, thus diluting the fantasy. Similarily, if the results of the battle were not relevant to the goal of the game or course of events in the game world, the player would feel that their efforts are pointless, also diluting the fantasy. [too in depth, trim] This focus on agency and fantasy largely places the pace, sequencing of events, and results of a game in the hands of the players, making it challenging for the game developers to tell a story. Valorant has managed to hijack this inverse relationship between player agency and storytelling ability; it provides players with high amounts of agency and fantasy while exploiting it's genre to advance its narrative outside of game sessions. 

But what is Valorant's genre? And how does it exploit this?

Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter. Players win rounds by planting a bomb on a site and defending it, taking out the enemy team, or defending a site from planters. Teams work together to create strategies and utilize their individual aiming and game sense skills to take duels and map control. The first team to take 13 rounds wins the game. There is no "beating" Valorant because there is no formal ending; the main motivation for playing is to improve and win. This motivation structure means that players will stick around for a while, perpetually trying to improve, often engaging with Valorant-related content online to this end. [talk about your personal exp, not generally]

Games like Valorant do a phenomonal job of providing player agency and fantasy because the players are in complete control of how a round and game will play out. Whenever I take a bad fight and die or win a trade, I experience the dread or satisfaction of having directly made an impact on how the round will end. In other words, my actions feel like they matter, and this motivates me to plan carefully and immerses me in fantasy of being a combatant. If I didn't have full control of my character, or if my battles were not relevant to the outcome of the game, I would be pulled out of the combat experience, thus diluting the fantasy. A fantasy which Valorant adds layers on top of by allowing players to select a role -- such as smokes, healer, initiator, duelist -- and a character. You can be anything from a ghostly appartus to a bomb-loving technitian. Having this choice allows me to tweak the fantasy that I step into during a game to my liking, making it all the more compelling.

Giving the players so much agency makes it very difficult for the developers to tell a story through gameplay, since they don't know what characters will be involved, what decisions will be made, or how a game will play out. And indeed, they don't try push a narrative during a game; there is no "beating" Valorant since there is no story to reach the end of. The main motivation to continue playing is to perpetually improve and win. This means that players can stick around for a long time, and they indeed do. I myself have played the game for years, and I still feel like there is much to learn. I regularly engage with Valorant content outside of the game to try and improve/strategize - I, and many others, play the meta game.

The Valorant developers know that this is the type of game that people tend to stick to for a while and engage with outside of the game platform. They leverage this to tell a story through content drops in and outside of the game over a long period of time. This storytelling technique is subtle and has many moving parts. New maps are dropped as the characters discover new areas in the game's story, and they often contain small details or easter eggs that hint at what is going on in the overarching narrative. These details are sometimes altered from patch-to-patch to suggest that something has happened. For example, there is a a room in the training map where you can see what emails the characters are sending to one another, and these are regularly updated, and often pertain to new content drops, like maps and characters. 

Valorant releases cinematics alongside content drops to help players further piece together what is happening in the game's story. The cinematics by themselves are short and work as standalone videos, but if you watch them while paying mind to all the new content and easter eggs, you understand that they are telling a story. This story telling technique is anything but direct, and it requires that players pay attention over a long period of time; but it deeply enriches the world-building and gives players more to be interested in and look forward to. Some might argue that this type of storytelling is too fragmented and indirect. However, I would contend that this game is meant to played over a long period of time and to be interacted with outside of the platform, making it appropiate for Valorant to push a narrative in this way. Most of all, it allows them to retain high player agency while still incoperating storytelling elements into their game, which results in something that feels much deeper and more engaging your typical fighting PVP game. 

SECOND DRAFT
Most online player versus player games struggle with storytelling. When battle of any sort is the main focus of a game, agency must be high to accomodate the fantasy of being a combatant: If the player does not have full control over their character, it pulls them right out of the experience of combat, thus diluting the fantasy. The way that a round or battle plays out is completely in the hands of the players, making it very difficult for the devs to tell a story.
