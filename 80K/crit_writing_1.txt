FIRST DRAFT
Most player versus player games focus on agency. When player competition is the main focus of a game, agency must be high to accomodate the fantasy of being a competitor. For example, Mortal Combat puts you in the fantasy of being a powerful warrior who has to defeat his opponents. If the player didn't have full control over their character, it would pull them right out of the combat experience, thus diluting the fantasy. Similarily, if the results of the battle were not relevant to the goal of the game or course of events in the game world, the player would feel that their efforts are pointless, also diluting the fantasy. [too in depth, trim] This focus on agency and fantasy largely places the pace, sequencing of events, and results of a game in the hands of the players, making it challenging for the game developers to tell a story. Valorant has managed to hijack this inverse relationship between player agency and storytelling ability; it provides players with high amounts of agency and fantasy while exploiting it's genre to advance its narrative outside of game sessions. 

But what is Valorant's genre? And how does it exploit this?

Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter. Players win rounds by planting a bomb on a site and defending it, taking out the enemy team, or defending a site from planters. Teams work together to create strategies and utilize their individual aiming and game sense skills to take duels and map control. The first team to take 13 rounds wins the game. There is no "beating" Valorant because there is no formal ending; the main motivation for playing is to improve and win. This motivation structure means that players will stick around for a while, perpetually trying to improve, often engaging with Valorant-related content online to this end.

SECOND DRAFT
Most online player versus player games struggle with storytelling. When battle of any sort is the main focus of a game, agency must be high to accomodate the fantasy of being a combatant: If the player does not have full control over their character, it pulls them right out of the experience of combat, thus diluting the fantasy. The way that a round or battle plays out is completely in the hands of the players, making it very difficult for the devs to tell a story.
